    When you think of programming, you might imagine some really smart person hacking away at a supercomputer with a bunch of 1's and 0's flying everywhere. In reality, programming is basically giving instructions to the computer by using a series of commands in a special programming language (you might have heard of Java and Python, for example). Since each programming language looks different from every other programming language, we won't try to teach you commands in a specific language. Instead, you can test out giving commands to the computer by trying out the visual exercises below.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most of the commands you'll be giving the computer in the exercises below were named by us so that they make sense when you're trying to animate the figures below. This means that in this case, the commands to the computer will look like "move right".
  </p>
  <p>
    However, there is one important command we also let you practice with in the exercises because it exists in all programming languages in some form. It's what we call <i>printing</i>, and it doesn't mean printing something out to a printer! In programming, we refer to printing as writing something to the screen.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can print all different types of variables: strings, like "Hello World", integers, like 5, floats, like 3.4...etc. The only one you need to be careful with is arrays. We will have an exercise where you print an array once you learn about iteration, so stay tuned!
