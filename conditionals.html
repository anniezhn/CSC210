    When programming, it can be helpful to have something that lets a program decide on a course of action based upon
    user input or some other criteria. For example, say you want to add numbers onto a running total but only if the number
    entered is greater than 5.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is where <span class="b">conditionals</span> come in. Conditionals evaluate the truth of a statement. For example, x > 5. If x is greater
    than 5, meaning the statement is <span class="b">true</span>, the statement(s) after the conditional is executed. If x is less than or
    equal to 5, then the statement is <span class="b">false</span> and the statement(s) after the conditional is skipped over.
