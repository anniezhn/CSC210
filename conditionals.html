    When programming, it can be helpful to have something that lets a program decide on a course of action based upon
    user input or some other criteria. For example, say you want to add numbers onto a running total, but only if the number
    entered is greater than 5.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is where <span class="b">conditionals</span> come in. Conditionals evaluate the truth of a statement. For example, let's think about the statement "x > 5". If x is greater
    than 5, meaning the statement is <span class="b">true</span>, the statement(s) after the conditional is executed. If x is less than or
    equal to 5, then the statement is <span class="b">false</span> and the statement(s) after the conditional is skipped over.
  </p>
  <p>
  In most programming languages, we write conditionals in a form similar to this: <br /> <br />
  <b>if</b> <i>statement1</i><br />
  <b>then</b> action1<br />
  <b>else if</b> <i>statement2</i><br />
  <b>then</b> action2<br />
  else
  <b>action3</b><br /><br />

In this case, your program will perform action1 when statement1 is true. If statement1 isn't true, then your program will perform action2 if statement2 is true and action3 otherwise.</p>

<p>Remember that statements look like the example we did above: stuff like "x > 5", "number of people > number of cars", and "my name is longer than your name".</p>

<p>You can have conditionals which look a little different than the example above. If you don't want to do anything if a statement is false, you could just have an if check without any else's. And you can have any number of "else if" statements (or none at all) to handle any number of different cases.</p>

        Conditionals can also be used to decide which path to take when something is <span class="b">not</span> true.
        <br/>
        The exclamation mark, <span class="b">!</span>, is the symbol for <span class="b">not</span> and
        usually appears before the expression it is negating. For example:
        <br/>
        If x is true, then !x is false. If y = 25, y > 50 is false. !(y > 50) is true.
      </p>
      <p>
        Drag a value to 'x' which causes the below statement to be true.
      </p>
      <div class="cond">
        <div class="compare">! (not)</div>
        <div id="x2" class="xDrop">x</div>
        <div class="compare">&lt; (less than) 25</div>
      </div>
      <div class="choices">
        <div class="xChoice x2Choice">7</div>
        <div class="xChoice x2Choice">25</div>
        <div class="xChoice x2Choice">17</div>
        <div class="xChoice x2Choice">55</div>
      </div>
      <div class="condResult"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="ex3" class="noDisplay">

      <p>
        Sometimes you want to do something only when two items are true. You can use <span class="b">and</span> to test two conditions.
        <br/>
        Usually double-ampersand, <span class="b">&amp;&amp;</span> is the symbol for <span class="b">and</span>. It goes between the
        two conditions to be tested.
        <br/>
        If x is true and y is true, then the whole statement is true. But if either one is false, the whole statement is false. For example:
        <br/>
        If x is 25 and y is 50, x < y &amp;&amp; y < 100 is true. If we change y to 150, then the statement is false, as y (150) is not less than 100,
        even though x (25) is still less than y (150).
      </p>
      <p>
        Drag values to 'x' and 'y' that makes the whole statement true.
